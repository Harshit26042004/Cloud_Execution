Benefits of This Approach
Flexibility: You can use this method when you want to combine blocking I/O operations with asynchronous programming without needing an additional library like aiofiles.
Simplicity: The standard file I/O methods are straightforward and easy to use, making it clear how files are being read while still leveraging the asynchronous capabilities of asyncio.
